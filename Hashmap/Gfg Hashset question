// User function Template for Java
/*Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 7
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 is appearing twice and 
its first appearence is at index 2 
which is less than 3 whose first 
occuring index is 3.

Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: -1
Explanation: 
All elements appear only once so 
answer is -1.

    // Function to return the position of the first repeating element.
